<blockquote id="opening-quote">Perpetual Peace</blockquote>
<p>
	We need not try to decide whether this satirical inscription, (once found on a Dutch innkeeper’s signboard above the picture of a churchyard) is aimed at mankind in general, or at the rulers of states in particular, unwearying in their love of war, or perhaps only at the philosophers who cherish the sweet dream of perpetual peace.
	The author of the present sketch would make one stipulation, however.
	The practical politician stands upon a definite footing with the theorist: with great self-complacency he looks down upon him as a mere pedant whose empty ideas can threaten no danger to the state (starting as it does from principles derived from experience), and who may always be permitted to knock down his eleven skittles at once without a wordly-wise statesman needing to disturb himself.
	Hence, in the event of a quarrel arising between the two, the practical statesman must always act consistently, and not scent danger to the state behind opinions ventured by the theoretical politician at random and publicly expressed.
	With which saving clause (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clausula salvatoria</i>) the author will herewith consider himself duly and expressly protected against all malicious misinterpretation.
